# finance_analysis.

# Overview
Welcome to the Finance Analysis repository! This repository contains Python algorithms and analysis tools for financial data, implemented using Jupyter notebooks. The focus is on key financial metrics and strategies, including:

Hystorical Average Analysis
Simple Moving Average (SMA)
Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Momentum Indicator
Backtesting of SMA and EMA strategies

# Features
* Simple Moving Average (SMA): Calculate and visualize the simple moving average of financial time series data.
* Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Calculate and visualize the exponential moving average for financial time series data.
* Momentum Indicator: Analyze and visualize momentum indicators to gauge the speed and strength of price movements.
* Backtesting: Implement backtesting strategies to evaluate the performance of SMA and EMA trading strategies over historical data.

# Requirements 
In order to run the Jupyter notebooks and scripts, you'll need the following Python packages:

numpy
pandas
datetime
pandas_datareader
matplotlib
seaborn 
plotly
yfinance 
scikit-learn
scipy
jupyter

# Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finance_analysis.git
cd finance_analysis
Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have pip and a virtual environment set up, then install the necessary packages.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Navigate to the repository directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
This will open the Jupyter interface in your default web browser.

# Usage
Open Notebooks:

Navigate to the Jupyter interface in your browser and open the relevant notebooks under the notebooks directory.

# Running Analysis:

* Historical Average Analysis: Open 001_historical_average_analysis.ipynb and access section 4 to calculate and visualize the historical average analysis.
* SMA Analysis: Open 002_moving_average.ipynb and access section 5 to calculate and visualize the Simple Moving Average.
* EMA Analysis: Open 002_moving_average.ipynb and access section 5 for the Exponential Moving Average analysis.
* Momentum Indicator: Open 003_momentum_analysis.ipynb and access section 5 to calculate and visualize momentum.
* Backtesting: Open 001_backtesting_analysis.ipynb to backtest SMA and EMA trading strategies.

Modify and Experiment:
Feel free to modify the code in the notebooks to suit your specific needs or experiment with different financial datasets.
